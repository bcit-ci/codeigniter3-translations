Translations for CodeIgniter System Messages
############################################

Note: In preparation for the 3.0 release, we have switched to a more proper branching model. 
    The *master* branch has been tagged for release, and all new changes or additions will be to the *develop* branch.

This project contains translations for the CodeIgniter 
system messages folder, **system/language/english**.

Copy the folder(s) for the idioms you are interested in,
from inside the **language** folder of this project to your 
**application/language** folder.

You may then use the CodeIgniter Language class to reference the translations
directly, or you can set the default language in **application/config/config**
to the idiom appropriate for your webapp.

There have been several questions about RTL languages, but that is not
something addressed in CodeIgniter. The suggested approach is to keep any
translations in left-to-right order, and to deal with right-to-left
rendering through the "dir" attribute of an HTML element, or the "direction"
attribute in CSS.
